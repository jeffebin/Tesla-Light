You will need
1- Custom Made PCB, you can find the GERBER file and have it manufactored.  
2-Three DIODE SCHOTTKY 30V 200MA DO35
3-An Ultrabirght LED, I used this version: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CUGA218/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1


Notes:
Once the board is soldered, if you cut the diode tails it will be slightly less bright but still work well.
